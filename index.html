                    <div class="studio">I am a senior at North High School who is going into USI with a major in Computer Science. I like to play video games, penguins, and watching anime. Those last two combine later on
                        I've been interested in computer science since my dad introduced them to me to a computer when I was a kid. At first I was just playing games, not wondering about anything.
                        Then I started to get curious and I broke my computer apart and started to look inside it and thats where my love for tech and computer stuff started. </div>
